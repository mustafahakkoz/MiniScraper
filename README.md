## MiniScraper

Fetching some of the user information by exploiting the bug of follow button in Twitter.

It reads the usernames from a given list (followers of @nevsinmengu in my example), fetches user info such as **username, id, followers_count, protected and age_gated**, then builds a whitelist and black list based on a condition.
